# React + Vite Frontend

Clone the main repository  
-----------------------------  
npm i - Install dependencies  
npm run dev - Run the application  
-------------------------------------  
Backend consists of two Python projects which allow AI features to be used via an API call using Flask.    
1) Server branch - Crop Recommendation
   
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.  
Run `python app.py`.  

2 Models - Crop Recommendation & Crop Disease
------------------------------------  
Unfortunately, since the AI models used are heavyweight, they could not be deployed to Vercel and need to be run from localhost.
